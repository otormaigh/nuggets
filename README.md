Hello there, contained in this repo is a collection of nuggets of information from various topics. It has no real purpose other than allowing me to better manage and share things I've learned.

Theme is originally from [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) minus some un-needed elements to try and pare down the size of the generated HTML files to the bare minimum. I'm not a web developer by trade, so this is still a work in-progress, which means that I will inevitable make some novice mistakes, if you notice any please do reach out and let me know.
